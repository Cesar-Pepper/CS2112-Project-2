# CS2112-Assignment-2

Second assignment I completed for the CS2112 (Honors Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures) course at Cornell University.
This project consisted of cryptography and developing various ciphers (RSA, Viginiere, Caesar, etc.) to process/encode/decode files and
corresponding ciphertext.
